# ac-movie-list
This is my movie-list coding practice in Alpha Camp. More than the practice requirement, I connect the index page data with favorite page data by local storage, so the movie added in favorite list won't disappear when moving to new page or changing display mode.

# Movie List
A simple web application for movie fanatic

## Features
